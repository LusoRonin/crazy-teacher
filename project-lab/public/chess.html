          Our version of chess is played against an AI and the player is in control of the White Army. In order to move a piece, simply click and drag the chosen piece to one of the highlighted squares (since these represent the possible moves of the piece). To win the game, you must checkmate the opposing army's King. Good luck and have fun!

          Chess is an abstract strategy board game for two players. Each player controls an army of white or black pieces and tries to checkmate the opposing player’s King. Although there have been several variations of this game through the ages, the current version’s rules were established back in 15th century Europe. However, organized chess only arose in the 19th century, with the first chess competitions starting to appear during this time. To distinguish it from other types of chess, such as Shogi (Japanese Chess) or Xiangqi (Chinese Chess), this game is sometimes referred to as Western Chess. The current Chess World Champion is Ding Liren, who won the title by defeating Ian Nepomniachtchi in the 2023 Chess World Championship, after previous Champion, Chess Grandmaster Magnus Carlsen, refused to defend his title.
