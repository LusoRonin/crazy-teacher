      <div class="details-modal-content">
        <p>
          Our version of chess is played against an AI and the player is in control of the Black Pieces. In order to move a piece, simply click on it and then click on the square you want to move it to (if the square is highlighted, it means that it is a valid move). Remember that you can only move your pieces diagonally and that you can only move forward. If you reach the other side of the board, your piece will be promoted and will be able to move backwards as well. If you can capture an enemy piece, you must do so as it is mandatory. To win the game, you must capture all of the enemy pieces. Good luck and have fun!

        <h1>A Brief View on Checkers</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="details-modal-content">
        <p>
          Checkers is a strategy board game for two players that involves the usage of two sets of pieces of opposing colors that are moved diagonally through a square 8x8, 10x10 or 12x12 boards, depending on the version. In contrast to Chess, if it is possible to capture one of the opponentâ€™s pieces then it is mandatory, by official rules, that the player captures said piece. The game of Checkers was developed from Alquerque, a similar board game that is believed to have originated in the Middle East. In 2007, a Canadian team of computer scientists solved weekly a game of American Checkers (8x8 format). In this case, from the starting position, perfect play by each side would result in a draw. The current World Champion for Checkers is the Italian Matteo Bernini.
